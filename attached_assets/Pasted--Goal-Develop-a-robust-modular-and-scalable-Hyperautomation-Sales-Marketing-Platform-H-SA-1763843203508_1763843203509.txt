**Goal:** Develop a robust, modular, and scalable **Hyperautomation Sales & Marketing Platform (H-SAMP)** backend using Python and Django REST Framework, specifically tailored for the **International Cargo Logistics market in Ecuador**. The platform must automate the full commercial cycle from lead generation to quote follow-up.

### 1. Core Architecture & Stack
* **Target Language & Framework:** Python 3.11+ and Django REST Framework.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (for relational data integrity).
* **Modularity:** The application must be structured into three main Django apps: `CommsModule`, `MarketingModule`, and `SalesModule`.
* **Localization:** Models and user-facing messages must be ready for Spanish localization (Ecuador context).

### 2. Module Requirements and Functions

#### A. Sales Module (CRM, Quoting & Scheduling)
* **Data Models:** Create core models for `Lead`, `Opportunity`, `Quote`, and `TaskReminder`.
* **Automated Quoting System (Critical Logic):**
    * Implement an API endpoint `/api/sales/quote/generate/` that accepts **Logistics Parameters** (Origin, Destination, Incoterm, Cargo Type, Base Rate, **Parametrized Minimum Profit Margin**).
    * **Function:** Calculate the `Final_Client_Price` based on the formula: `Final Price = Base Rate + Parametrized Minimum Profit`.
    * **Persistence:** Store the generated quote details and calculation in the `Quote` model.
    * **Follow-up:** Implement logic to track the `QuoteStatus` (Sent, Viewed, Pending) and automatically create a `TaskReminder` 48 hours after sending if status is still 'Sent'.
* **Scheduling:**
    * Endpoint to handle virtual meeting booking requests.
    * **External Sync Stub:** Mock functions for syncing confirmed meetings with Google Calendar and Outlook APIs, including setting a 15-minute alert for the human sales agent.

#### B. Comms Module (Centralized Inbox & Integrations)
* **Function:** Create a centralized `InboxMessage` model to aggregate communication.
* **Centralization Logic:** Implement API endpoints to simulate receiving webhooks/data from:
    * Social Media DMs/Comments (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, TikTok).
    * **WhatsApp API Integration Stub:** A mock endpoint `/api/comms/whatsapp/inbound/` that accepts a message and logs it to `InboxMessage`, linking it to the corresponding `Lead`.
    * Direct Email communication.
* **CRM Linkage:** Every message in `InboxMessage` must link back to the `Lead` model in the Sales Module.

#### C. Marketing Module (Outbound Automation)
* **Email Engine:**
    * Implement a function `send_mass_email(segment_id, template_id)` that is highly **parameterizable** (e.g., personalized fields from the Lead model).
    * **External Sync Stub:** Mock function for sending emails via an external provider (e.g., SendGrid/Mailgun).
* **Social Media Posting Scheduler:**
    * Implement a simple scheduler model for creating posts with defined `PostTime` and `TargetRRSS`.
    * **External Sync Stub:** Mock function for executing the post request to the respective social media APIs (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok).

### 3. Output Request (Boilerplate Code)
Generate the foundational file structure, the primary `settings.py` file configured for the three modules, and the detailed data model definitions for the `Lead` (in `SalesModule`) and `InboxMessage` (in `CommsModule`).
